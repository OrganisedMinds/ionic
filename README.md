# General mobile questions

## Scalability

- What is our phone > phablet > tablet > desktop strategy?
- How does that strategy influence workspaces?
  - workspaces do not fit in to a mobile-app
  - workspaces with stacks are a USP
  - groups contradict workspaces
  - workspace-members are a group
  - teams vs groups?
